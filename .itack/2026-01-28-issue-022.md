# board command silently returns empty data instead of failing on bad state

When running `itack board`, if the data is in a bad state (missing data branch, issues not migrated, etc.), the command silently shows 0 issues instead of detecting the problem and failing with a helpful error.

## Observed behavior

- `itack board` showed 0 issues when data existed but was in bad state
- Running `itack init` fixed the problem

## Root cause

`load_all_issues_from_data_branch()` in `src/storage/db.rs` has multiple silent failure modes:

1. If data branch doesn't exist, returns empty vec (lines 366-370)
2. If `.itack/` directory missing in branch, returns empty vec (lines 377-379)
3. Individual file parse errors are swallowed silently (lines 389-399)

## Expected behavior

The command should detect these bad states and either:
- Fail with a clear error message explaining what's wrong
- Warn the user that data may be incomplete and suggest running `itack init` to repair

## Files to modify

- `src/storage/db.rs` - Add validation/error handling in `load_all_issues_from_data_branch()`
- Potentially `src/commands/board.rs` - Handle validation errors appropriately
