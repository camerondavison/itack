# Organize issue markdown files into status-based folders

Reorganize issue markdown files from flat structure into status-based folders:

- `open/` - contains open and in-progress issues
- `done/` - contains done and wont-fix issues

This will make it easier to browse issues by their current state and keep the directory cleaner as the number of issues grows.
